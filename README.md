# CSCI 235 Spring 2024

## SOFTWARE DESIGN AND ANALYSIS II

The primary focus of this course is the design and analysis of algorithms and abstract data types. To this end, it introduces elementary data structures with related algorithms and their use in problem-solving. The course also covers core computer science concepts such as abstraction, algorithm complexity, performance analysis, and the trade-offs between running time, storage size, clarity, and extensibility that are at the core of software design. As a sequel to CSCI 135, it will also enhance your skills in C++ and Object-Oriented Programming by introducing new tools such as Templates, Inheritance, and Polymorphism, and extend your understanding of pointers and dynamic memory allocation.
